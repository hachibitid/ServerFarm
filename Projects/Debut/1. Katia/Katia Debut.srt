Hi everyone, nice to meet you!

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,600
My name is Katia Cerrus-
or you can call me Katia, just like everyone else did.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,220
I'm a cerberus who works as Hell's gatekeeper.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,680
One could simply say i'm a security guard.. hehe~

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,520
As a Cerberus, i have 3 different personalities.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,700
First, we have Kat-
who's actually the person you're listening to right now.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,640
Then, we have Kati-
the 'cold and sarcastic' second-eldest daughter.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,640
Say hi, Kati!

00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,220

Last but not least, we have the youngest daughter which is-

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,220
Tia! she's quite a shy one that's-
Simply the "shy-shy" type!

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,220
Come on Tia, say hi!

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,320
