[Introduction]
Is it on? hello?? test? OH YEA it's on! okay, EHEEEMM!
Ya!! I'm Asuka Nocturnia from Hachibit Indonesia! 
I'm a geek demi-human who were born in the woods.

[Facts and Features]
I originated from Planet Terra, or what you guys usually call Earth.
Yep, it's the same planet! only in a different universe.
I'm so lucky because now i'm proudly a citizen of Hachibit.
You're right, Terra of Hachibit Universe. 
it has a radius of 1,732km cuz my height is 173,2cm. I've been made an Icon and the Representative of Terra Hachibit.

My physical features are quite distinctive, 
My hair is white! it's quite long for a boy. also, i have green eyes.

About my relationship, no need to ask.. i've been dating for the past 20 years.. with my gadgets.

[Hobbies]
I have quite a lot of hobbies, 
My life usually circles around music.
So it has became one of my hobbies and as a geek, ofcourse computer weighs the same weight.

I love songwriting as a hobby,
And I'm weak against beautiful and unique Chord Progressions.
Even the one that felt weird, yet still enjoyable.

[Favorites]
Food, I have a unique taste. I love Fr-uit Sa-lad.. Fruit Salad! Daaaaaaamn son. I haven't been able to resist it.
Drinks, I love carbonated drinks like Sparkling Water, Root Beer, and also Pure/Neat Soda.
for Fruits tho, i dunno why a lotta people hate this, but i'm so dead for Durian..
I still don't get why people don't enjoy it. it's fascinating.. i really love my Durian.
Could be because i'm a demi-human? who knows? but I still love my Durian anyway.

[Current Condition]
Right! I wanna spill the tea a bit.. ever since i'm being a citizen, i'm obligated to stream/tube.
Most of the times my content will circle around gaming, tips, maybe funny moments? (ain't no funny moment streams) 
i also have a plan to do skits, going live while coding- EH EH EH i've blabbered enough! cut cut, skip!

[RGB Comrades]
I have 2 partners beside me,
The most eye-catching outta all of us, Riru Steina..
And the logic and silent task completer, Arata Koyama.
F'real tho, he's that kind of guy.

Our generation have a nickname. it's RGB. you know why?
it's literally 'cuz riru's red, i'm green, and arata's blue.
its red green blue! just like my twinkle lights..
Eeeh~ it looks so cuteeee~~ (feminine words)- AHHAHA

[Debut Stream]
'kay! Eheeemm,, god i feel so thirsty..
well, see you on Saturday, June 11th, 2022 for
a stream with RGB. yup, we're doing it simultaneously.

[Closing]
I'll close this with bringing you guys thru my intro into to my room.
Yoru-wa Ni-jyuu yon-jikan! Welcome to my Bedroom! hahaha (aneh banget sumpah)

[Epilogue]

You were really weird,
You were really weird,
You were over.
